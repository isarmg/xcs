use crate::raw_rwlock::RawRwLock;

/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// This lock uses a task-fair locking policy which avoids both reader and
/// writer starvation. This means that readers trying to acquire the lock will
/// block even if the lock is unlocked when there are writers waiting to acquire
/// the lock. Because of this, attempts to recursively acquire a read lock
/// within a single thread may result in a deadlock.
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies `Send` to be shared across threads and `Sync` to
/// allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards returned from the
/// locking methods implement `Deref` (and `DerefMut` for the `write` methods)
/// to allow access to the contained of the lock.
///
/// # Fairness
///
/// A typical unfair lock can often end up in a situation where a single thread
/// quickly acquires and releases the same lock in succession, which can starve
/// other threads waiting to acquire the rwlock. While this improves throughput
/// because it doesn't force a context switch when a thread tries to re-acquire
/// a rwlock it has just released, this can starve other threads.
///
/// This rwlock uses [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)
/// to ensure that the lock will be fair on average without sacrificing
/// throughput. This is done by forcing a fair unlock on average every 0.5ms,
/// which will force the lock to go to the next thread waiting for the rwlock.
///
/// Additionally, any critical section longer than 1ms will always use a fair
/// unlock, which has a negligible impact on throughput considering the length
/// of the critical section.
///
/// You can also force a fair unlock by calling `RwLockReadGuard::unlock_fair`
/// or `RwLockWriteGuard::unlock_fair` when unlocking a mutex instead of simply
/// dropping the guard.
///
/// # Differences from the standard library `RwLock`
///
/// - Supports atomically downgrading a write lock into a read lock.
/// - Task-fair locking policy instead of an unspecified platform default.
/// - No poisoning, the lock is released normally on panic.
/// - Only requires 1 word of space, whereas the standard library boxes the
///   `RwLock` due to platform limitations.
/// - Can be statically constructed.
/// - Does not require any drop glue when dropped.
/// - Inline fast path for the uncontended case.
/// - Efficient handling of micro-contention using adaptive spinning.
/// - Allows raw locking & unlocking without a guard.
/// - Supports eventual fairness so that the rwlock is fair on average.
/// - Optionally allows making the rwlock fair by calling
///   `RwLockReadGuard::unlock_fair` and `RwLockWriteGuard::unlock_fair`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use parking_lot::RwLock;
///
/// let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read();
///     let r2 = lock.read();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write();
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here
/// ```
